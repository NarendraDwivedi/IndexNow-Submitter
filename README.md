## üìñ Detailed Walkthrough

The application is organized into three simple tabs for different submission methods.

### 1. Submit Using Sitemap
This is the most powerful mode for submitting your entire site.

* **Sitemap URL:** Enter the full URL to your `sitemap.xml` file.
* **Fetch Sitemap:** Click to download and display all URLs from the sitemap in the "Fetched URL" list.
* **API Key:** Your unique 32-character key.
* **Generate API Key:** Creates a new, random key for you.
* **Key Location:** The full URL on your website where the key file is hosted (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/your-api-key.txt`).
* **Verify:** Checks if the key file at the Key Location exists and contains the correct API Key.
* **Extract From Key Location:** Fetches the content from the Key Location URL and places it in the API Key field.
* **Fetched URL List:** All URLs are loaded here. You can manually check or uncheck them.
* **Action Buttons:**
    * `Save As Project`: Saves your API Key, Key Location, and Sitemap URL for later use.
    * `Open Project`: Loads a previously saved project.
    * `Submit To IndexNow`: Submits all **checked** URLs to the IndexNow API.

### 2. Submit Using File
Ideal for submitting a custom list of URLs.
* **Load From File...:** Opens a dialog to select a `.txt` file. The file should contain one URL per line.
* The application will load all valid URLs from the file into the list, ready for submission.
* The API Key, Key Location, and Action buttons work the same way as the Sitemap tab.

### 3. Submit Individual URL
The quickest way to submit one or just a few URLs.
* **Multiline Input:** Use the radio buttons to toggle the textbox between a single-line and a multi-line view, complete with scrollbars.
* Simply paste your URL(s) into the box (one per line if in multi-line mode).
* Fill in your API details and click the submit button.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è (Optional) Advanced Setup: Using the Cloudflare Worker

For users who don't want to manually upload a key file via FTP, you can deploy a free Cloudflare Worker to handle key hosting and generation automatically.

  ### What it Does
  This script, when deployed, creates two endpoints on your domain:
  1. `https://your.domain/indexnow/generate`: Generates a new API key.
  2. `https://your.domain/indexnow/YOUR_KEY`: Acts as the key file itself.
